# 🧬 Diabetes Prediction App (Streamlit)

A simple web app built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a person is likely to have diabetes, based on health features such as age, BMI, cholesterol, and more.

This project is perfect for learning:
- Machine learning (logistic regression)
- Building a frontend using Streamlit
- Saving/loading models with `joblib`
- Using VS Code + Git + Python environments

---

## 🚀 Features
- Clean web interface (Streamlit)
- Slider & dropdown inputs for user data
- Real-time prediction using a trained model
- Built fully in Python

├── app.py                # Main Streamlit web app
├── train_model.py        # ML training script (Logistic Regression)

## 📊 Dataset Used
- `load_diabetes()` from `sklearn.datasets`
- 442 samples with 10 baseline variables
- Target (a continuous value) was binarized: 
  - `> 140` → diabetic (1)
  - `<= 140` → non-diabetic (0)

## ✅ Setup Instructions

### 🔹 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes_streamlit_app.git
cd diabetes_streamlit_app
```

### 🔹 2. (Optional but Recommended) Create a Virtual Environment
Using Anaconda:
```bash
conda create -n diabetes_env python=3.9
conda activate diabetes_env
```

Or using `venv`:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

### 🔹 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don’t have a requirements.txt yet, install manually:
```bash
pip install streamlit scikit-learn pandas joblib
```

---

### 🔹 4. Train the Model
```bash
python train_model.py
```
This saves a trained logistic regression model as `model.pkl`

### 🔹 5. Run the Web App
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## 🧠 Troubleshooting: What Went Wrong & How I Solved It

### ❌ Issue:
```
streamlit : The term 'streamlit' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet...
```

### ✅ Fix:
This happened because VS Code didn't recognize my Conda environment properly. Here's how I solved it:

1. Opened **Anaconda Prompt**
2. Activated my environment manually:
   ```bash
   conda activate r_env
   ```
3. Then launched VS Code from that prompt:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

That ensured VS Code recognized `conda`, `streamlit`, and all packages.

✅ Lesson: If `streamlit` or `conda` isn’t recognized in VS Code, launch it from Anaconda Prompt with the right environment activated.

🧠 Git Push Error: src refspec main does not match any
❌ The Issue
When trying to push my project to GitHub, I ran into this error:

bash
Copy
Edit
error: src refspec main does not match any
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git'
This happens because Git tries to push a branch called main, but my local branch was actually named master (older Git versions default to master).

✅ How I Solved It
I ran this command to see my current branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch
It showed:

markdown
Copy
Edit
* master
So I did either of the following:

✔ Option 1: Push the master branch as it is
bash
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin master
This pushed the project to GitHub successfully and made master the default branch.

✔ Option 2 (optional): Rename master to main
To align with modern Git naming conventions:

bash
Copy
Edit
git branch -m main
git push -u origin main
This renamed my branch locally and pushed it to GitHub under main.

✅ Lesson: Always check your local branch name with git branch before pushing — especially when setting up a new repo.
